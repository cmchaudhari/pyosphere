A script that simulates a flatted development environment to enable easy relative imports in **python**.

## Problem
<!-- A brief description of the issue we solved and how it can be annoying -->

<!--
- Running a file from a diff location spoils importing
- Confusing and complicated ways to import files in python (relative imports etc)
-->

## Solution
<!-- A pithy statement or two about the solution deployed -->

<!--
- Aggregation of hard-links of all py files into one folder
- Simply import 'filename'. No path or relative imports or anything of that sort needed.
-->

## Limitations
<!--  
- Multiple files with the same name
- Assumes that file paths etc. within the code isn't hard coded or static. Hopes that one has calculated paths using os.path or something similar.
